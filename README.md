# Splunk

## Description 
This Project is based on version 2 of the Boss of the SOC (BOTS) competition by Splunk. 

The BOTSv2 Dataset utilized was generated in August of 2017 by members of Splunk's Security Specialist team.

In this exercise, we have assumed the persona of Alice Bluebird, an analyst who was recommended to Grace Hoppy at Frothly (a beer company) to assist them with their recent issues.
